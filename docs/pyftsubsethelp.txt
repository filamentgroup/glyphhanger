pyftsubset -- OpenType font subsetter and optimizer

  pyftsubset is an OpenType font subsetter and optimizer, based on fontTools.
  It accepts any TT- or CFF-flavored OpenType (.otf or .ttf) or WOFF (.woff)
  font file. The subsetted glyph set is based on the specified glyphs
  or characters, and specified OpenType layout features.

  The tool also performs some size-reducing optimizations, aimed for using
  subset fonts as webfonts.  Individual optimizations can be enabled or
  disabled, and are enabled by default when they are safe.

Usage:
  pyftsubset font-file [glyph...] [--option=value]...

  At least one glyph or one of --gids, --gids-file, --glyphs, --glyphs-file,
  --text, --text-file, --unicodes, or --unicodes-file, must be specified.

Arguments:
  font-file
    The input font file.
  glyph
    Specify one or more glyph identifiers to include in the subset. Must be
    PS glyph names, or the special string '*' to keep the entire glyph set.

Initial glyph set specification:
  These options populate the initial glyph set. Same option can appear
  multiple times, and the results are accummulated.
  --gids=<NNN>[,<NNN>...]
      Specify comma/whitespace-separated list of glyph IDs or ranges as
      decimal numbers.  For example, --gids=10-12,14 adds glyphs with
      numbers 10, 11, 12, and 14.
  --gids-file=<path>
      Like --gids but reads from a file. Anything after a '#' on any line
      is ignored as comments.
  --glyphs=<glyphname>[,<glyphname>...]
      Specify comma/whitespace-separated PS glyph names to add to the subset.
      Note that only PS glyph names are accepted, not gidNNN, U+XXXX, etc
      that are accepted on the command line.  The special string '*' wil keep
      the entire glyph set.
  --glyphs-file=<path>
      Like --glyphs but reads from a file. Anything after a '#' on any line
      is ignored as comments.
  --text=<text>
      Specify characters to include in the subset, as UTF-8 string.
  --text-file=<path>
      Like --text but reads from a file. Newline character are not added to
      the subset.
  --unicodes=<XXXX>[,<XXXX>...]
      Specify comma/whitespace-separated list of Unicode codepoints or
      ranges as hex numbers, optionally prefixed with 'U+', 'u', etc.
      For example, --unicodes=41-5a,61-7a adds ASCII letters, so does
      the more verbose --unicodes=U+0041-005A,U+0061-007A.
      The special strings '*' will choose all Unicode characters mapped
      by the font.
  --unicodes-file=<path>
      Like --unicodes, but reads from a file. Anything after a '#' on any
      line in the file is ignored as comments.
  --ignore-missing-glyphs
      Do not fail if some requested glyphs or gids are not available in
      the font.
  --no-ignore-missing-glyphs
      Stop and fail if some requested glyphs or gids are not available
      in the font. [default]
  --ignore-missing-unicodes [default]
      Do not fail if some requested Unicode characters (including those
      indirectly specified using --text or --text-file) are not available
      in the font.
  --no-ignore-missing-unicodes
      Stop and fail if some requested Unicode characters are not available
      in the font.
      Note the default discrepancy between ignoring missing glyphs versus
      unicodes.  This is for historical reasons and in the future
      --no-ignore-missing-unicodes might become default.

Other options:
  For the other options listed below, to see the current value of the option,
  pass a value of '?' to it, with or without a '='.
  Examples:
    $ pyftsubset --glyph-names?
    Current setting for 'glyph-names' is: False
    $ ./pyftsubset --name-IDs=?
    Current setting for 'name-IDs' is: [1, 2]
    $ ./pyftsubset --hinting? --no-hinting --hinting?
    Current setting for 'hinting' is: True
    Current setting for 'hinting' is: False

Output options:
  --output-file=<path>
      The output font file. If not specified, the subsetted font
      will be saved in as font-file.subset.
  --flavor=<type>
      Specify flavor of output font file. May be 'woff' or 'woff2'.
      Note that WOFF2 requires the Brotli Python extension, available
      at https://github.com/google/brotli
  --with-zopfli
      Use the Google Zopfli algorithm to compress WOFF. The output is 3-8 %
      smaller than pure zlib, but the compression speed is much slower.
      The Zopfli Python bindings are available at:
      https://github.com/anthrotype/py-zopfli

Glyph set expansion:
  These options control how additional glyphs are added to the subset.
  --notdef-glyph
      Add the '.notdef' glyph to the subset (ie, keep it). [default]
  --no-notdef-glyph
      Drop the '.notdef' glyph unless specified in the glyph set. This
      saves a few bytes, but is not possible for Postscript-flavored
      fonts, as those require '.notdef'. For TrueType-flavored fonts,
      this works fine as long as no unsupported glyphs are requested
      from the font.
  --notdef-outline
      Keep the outline of '.notdef' glyph. The '.notdef' glyph outline is
      used when glyphs not supported by the font are to be shown. It is not
      needed otherwise.
  --no-notdef-outline
      When including a '.notdef' glyph, remove its outline. This saves
      a few bytes. [default]
  --recommended-glyphs
      Add glyphs 0, 1, 2, and 3 to the subset, as recommended for
      TrueType-flavored fonts: '.notdef', 'NULL' or '.null', 'CR', 'space'.
      Some legacy software might require this, but no modern system does.
  --no-recommended-glyphs
      Do not add glyphs 0, 1, 2, and 3 to the subset, unless specified in
      glyph set. [default]
  --layout-features[+|-]=<feature>[,<feature>...]
      Specify (=), add to (+=) or exclude from (-=) the comma-separated
      set of OpenType layout feature tags that will be preserved.
      Glyph variants used by the preserved features are added to the
      specified subset glyph set. By default, 'calt', 'ccmp', 'clig', 'curs',
      'kern', 'liga', 'locl', 'mark', 'mkmk', 'rclt', 'rlig' and all features
      required for script shaping are preserved. To see the full list, try
      '--layout-features=?'. Use '*' to keep all features.
      Multiple --layout-features options can be provided if necessary.
      Examples:
        --layout-features+=onum,pnum,ss01
            * Keep the default set of features and 'onum', 'pnum', 'ss01'.
        --layout-features-='mark','mkmk'
            * Keep the default set of features but drop 'mark' and 'mkmk'.
        --layout-features='kern'
            * Only keep the 'kern' feature, drop all others.
        --layout-features=''
            * Drop all features.
        --layout-features='*'
            * Keep all features.
        --layout-features+=aalt --layout-features-=vrt2
            * Keep default set of features plus 'aalt', but drop 'vrt2'.

Hinting options:
  --hinting
      Keep hinting [default]
  --no-hinting
      Drop glyph-specific hinting and font-wide hinting tables, as well
      as remove hinting-related bits and pieces from other tables (eg. GPOS).
      See --hinting-tables for list of tables that are dropped by default.
      Instructions and hints are stripped from 'glyf' and 'CFF ' tables
      respectively. This produces (sometimes up to 30%) smaller fonts that
      are suitable for extremely high-resolution systems, like high-end
      mobile devices and retina displays.
      XXX Note: Currently there is a known bug in 'CFF ' hint stripping that
      might make the font unusable as a webfont as they will be rejected by
      OpenType Sanitizer used in common browsers. For more information see:
      https://github.com/behdad/fonttools/issues/144
      The --desubroutinize options works around that bug.

Optimization options:
  --desubroutinize
      Remove CFF use of subroutinizes.  Subroutinization is a way to make CFF
      fonts smaller.  For small subsets however, desubroutinizing might make
      the font smaller.  It has even been reported that desubroutinized CFF
      fonts compress better (produce smaller output) WOFF and WOFF2 fonts.
      Also see note under --no-hinting.
  --no-desubroutinize [default]
      Leave CFF subroutinizes as is, only throw away unused subroutinizes.

Font table options:
  --drop-tables[+|-]=<table>[,<table>...]
      Specify (=), add to (+=) or exclude from (-=) the comma-separated
      set of tables that will be be dropped.
      By default, the following tables are dropped:
      'BASE', 'JSTF', 'DSIG', 'EBDT', 'EBLC', 'EBSC', 'SVG ', 'PCLT', 'LTSH'
      and Graphite tables: 'Feat', 'Glat', 'Gloc', 'Silf', 'Sill'
      and color tables: 'CBLC', 'CBDT', 'sbix'.
      The tool will attempt to subset the remaining tables.
      Examples:
        --drop-tables-='SVG '
            * Drop the default set of tables but keep 'SVG '.
        --drop-tables+=GSUB
            * Drop the default set of tables and 'GSUB'.
        --drop-tables=DSIG
            * Only drop the 'DSIG' table, keep all others.
        --drop-tables=
            * Keep all tables.
  --no-subset-tables+=<table>[,<table>...]
      Add to the set of tables that will not be subsetted.
      By default, the following tables are included in this list, as
      they do not need subsetting (ignore the fact that 'loca' is listed
      here): 'gasp', 'head', 'hhea', 'maxp', 'vhea', 'OS/2', 'loca',
      'name', 'cvt ', 'fpgm', 'prep', 'VMDX', 'DSIG' and 'CPAL'.
      By default, tables that the tool does not know how to subset and are not
      specified here will be dropped from the font, unless --passthrough-tables
      option is passed.
      Example:
         --no-subset-tables+=FFTM
            * Keep 'FFTM' table in the font by preventing subsetting.
  --passthrough-tables
      Do not drop tables that the tool does not know how to subset.
  --no-passthrough-tables
      Tables that the tool does not know how to subset and are not specified
      in --no-subset-tables will be dropped from the font. [default]
  --hinting-tables[-]=<table>[,<table>...]
      Specify (=), add to (+=) or exclude from (-=) the list of font-wide
      hinting tables that will be dropped if --no-hinting is specified,
      Examples:
        --hinting-tables-='VDMX'
            * Drop font-wide hinting tables except 'VDMX'.
        --hinting-tables=''
            * Keep all font-wide hinting tables (but strip hints from glyphs).
  --legacy-kern
      Keep TrueType 'kern' table even when OpenType 'GPOS' is available.
  --no-legacy-kern
      Drop TrueType 'kern' table if OpenType 'GPOS' is available. [default]

Font naming options:
  These options control what is retained in the 'name' table. For numerical
  codes, see: http://www.microsoft.com/typography/otspec/name.htm
  --name-IDs[+|-]=<nameID>[,<nameID>...]
      Specify (=), add to (+=) or exclude from (-=) the set of 'name' table
      entry nameIDs that will be preserved. By default only nameID 1 (Family)
      and nameID 2 (Style) are preserved. Use '*' to keep all entries.
      Examples:
        --name-IDs+=0,4,6
            * Also keep Copyright, Full name and PostScript name entry.
        --name-IDs=''
            * Drop all 'name' table entries.
        --name-IDs='*'
            * keep all 'name' table entries
  --name-legacy
      Keep legacy (non-Unicode) 'name' table entries (0.x, 1.x etc.).
      XXX Note: This might be needed for some fonts that have no Unicode name
      entires for English. See: https://github.com/behdad/fonttools/issues/146
  --no-name-legacy
      Drop legacy (non-Unicode) 'name' table entries [default]
  --name-languages[+|-]=<langID>[,<langID>]
      Specify (=), add to (+=) or exclude from (-=) the set of 'name' table
      langIDs that will be preserved. By default only records with langID
      0x0409 (English) are preserved. Use '*' to keep all langIDs.
  --obfuscate-names
      Make the font unusable as a system font by replacing name IDs 1, 2, 3, 4,
      and 6 with dummy strings (it is still fully functional as webfont).

Glyph naming and encoding options:
  --glyph-names
      Keep PS glyph names in TT-flavored fonts. In general glyph names are
      not needed for correct use of the font. However, some PDF generators
      and PDF viewers might rely on glyph names to extract Unicode text
      from PDF documents.
  --no-glyph-names
      Drop PS glyph names in TT-flavored fonts, by using 'post' table
      version 3.0. [default]
  --legacy-cmap
      Keep the legacy 'cmap' subtables (0.x, 1.x, 4.x etc.).
  --no-legacy-cmap
      Drop the legacy 'cmap' subtables. [default]
  --symbol-cmap
      Keep the 3.0 symbol 'cmap'.
  --no-symbol-cmap
      Drop the 3.0 symbol 'cmap'. [default]

Other font-specific options:
  --recalc-bounds
      Recalculate font bounding boxes.
  --no-recalc-bounds
      Keep original font bounding boxes. This is faster and still safe
      for all practical purposes. [default]
  --recalc-timestamp
      Set font 'modified' timestamp to current time.
  --no-recalc-timestamp
      Do not modify font 'modified' timestamp. [default]
  --canonical-order
      Order tables as recommended in the OpenType standard. This is not
      required by the standard, nor by any known implementation.
  --no-canonical-order
      Keep original order of font tables. This is faster. [default]
  --prune-unicode-ranges
      Update the 'OS/2 ulUnicodeRange*' bits after subsetting. The Unicode
      ranges defined in the OpenType specification v1.7 are intersected with
      the Unicode codepoints specified in the font's Unicode 'cmap' subtables:
      when no overlap is found, the bit will be switched off. However, it will
      *not* be switched on if an intersection is found.  [default]
  --no-prune-unicode-ranges
      Don't change the 'OS/2 ulUnicodeRange*' bits.
  --recalc-average-width
      Update the 'OS/2 xAvgCharWidth' field after subsetting.
  --no-recalc-average-width
      Don't change the 'OS/2 xAvgCharWidth' field. [default]

Application options:
  --verbose
      Display verbose information of the subsetting process.
  --timing
      Display detailed timing information of the subsetting process.
  --xml
      Display the TTX XML representation of subsetted font.

Example:
  Produce a subset containing the characters ' !"#$%' without performing
  size-reducing optimizations:

  $ pyftsubset font.ttf --unicodes="U+0020-0025" \
    --layout-features='*' --glyph-names --symbol-cmap --legacy-cmap \
    --notdef-glyph --notdef-outline --recommended-glyphs \
    --name-IDs='*' --name-legacy --name-languages='*'
